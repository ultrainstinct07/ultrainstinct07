## ⚔️ About Me

CRTA-certified Red Team Analyst with 1+ year of hands-on experience in:

- Web & Mobile Application Penetration Testing  
- Active Directory Attacks  
- Adversary Simulation  
- Security Automation & Tool Development  

Currently preparing for **OSCP** and focused on mastering real-world offensive tradecraft.

I build tools. I break systems. I automate attack paths. I document everything.

## 🛠 What I’m Building

### 🔥 Vulnessus
Enterprise-grade vulnerability scanning platform inspired by Nessus.

- Rust (Axum) backend
- Python-based plugin engine (via PyO3)
- Async multi-technique port scanning
- OS & service fingerprinting
- Encrypted credential handling (AES-256-GCM)
- Elasticsearch for scan data
- Real-time monitoring using SSE
- Docker-based deployment
- Modern Next.js frontend

This is not a toy scanner.  
This is long-term infrastructure.

## 🧠 Current Focus

- Advanced Web Exploitation
- Active Directory post-exploitation
- Privilege escalation (Windows & Linux)
- Custom offensive tooling
- Automation in Rust & Python
- OSCP-level lab grinding
